                <p>Hey!</p>
                <p>I'm Maddi. I'm majoring in Quantum Physics and work as a software engineer. My biggest 
                passion is space research! Ask me about real estate, solo travel, meditation or crocheting 
                and we're guaranteed to have a fun conversation.</p>
                <h4>Languages I'm Learning</h4>
                <p>French, Italian, Korean, Russian, Turkish and Spanish.</p>
                <p>I started learning Spanish at home when I was little, later teaching myself Italian 
                in middle school. French was my focus throughout high school. For 1/2 of last year, I put 
                my languages to use and traveled solo across Europe and Thailand. After living in Turkey 
                for a few months I started learning Turkish. Russian and Korean are more recent and I'm eager to meet other speakers!</p>

                I've really taken to language learning, and have become increasingly passionate on the

                <h4>Languages I'm Learning</h4>
                <p>Currently, I am studying 5 languages. These being; Korean, Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, and Finnish.</p>
                <p>I love immersing myself in various cultures and learning all about other traditions, food, and history.
